# macouiscripts

This is just a lazy first repository.  Here are a set of scripts for:

getieeeouilist: downloads and replaces the original (if different) a list of OUI assignments directly from the IEEE (oui.txt, oui2.txt as temp)

ouilookup: takes a full or partial MAC as a sole argument and combs oui.txt for that MAC.  When found, it spits out the owner organization

You will want to modify the paths to be wherever you put these scripts, probably somewhere executable in your PATH
